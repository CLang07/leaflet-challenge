# leaflet-challenge
 
Leaflet-Step-1 - Uses Leaflet to create a bubbule that displays all earthquakes the USGS has observed in the past day.  The bubbles are sized by magnitude and colored by depth.  An overlay of the plate boundaries is also displayed to show areas of active plate movement.  The overlay can be found at https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates.

Leaflet-Step-2 - The same data is shown in as step one but and control was created so toggles can be used to select data shown and type of basemap.
